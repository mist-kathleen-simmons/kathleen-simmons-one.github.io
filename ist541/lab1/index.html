      <p dir="ltr">For terrariums, you have to consider the size and type of container you want to fill, as well as location; i.e., a table, desk, or shelf, or large enough for a corner on the floor. In additon, to considering the type of lighting (See below).</p>

		  <p>You have decided that with your time constraints low maintenance plants would be ideal, and while you have discovered some slow growing, easy care foliage plants, like the Peperomia varienties, you have decided to begin with succulents. </p>
		  <p>In general, succulents definately fall into the easy care category; because many can endure some neglect. Now that you know the type of plants you want to start with, you now have to decide how to contain them. Will they be in individual pots, as a collection in a single pot, or in a terrarium?</p>
		  <p>You decided on the terrarium for a number of reasons, but mainly because they look like a piece of art. In addition to being a functional display of plants.</p>
