	  <p> You may have heard about a clean air study regarding houseplants from NASA, in the 1990's. The insinuation of the report was that certain common household plants could clean household air toxicity, more commonly known as volatile organic compounds, or VOCâ€™s. Many of these toxic compounds come from things we use every day in the home.</p>
	  <p>There is truth to the study, but not to the measures that were hyped, according to Molly Williams. What escaped the media was that these studies were completed in controlled environments, and not the average home where frequent use of these items like, hairspray, nail polish, and the gas stove occurred. Even with the misinformation espoused by the media, it didnâ€™t stop people from buying new plants, which is how foliage plants of all shapes and sizes have become so popular in recent years.</p>
