         <p>Being a plant parent can be as easy or as difficult as you want to make it. I suggest taking baby steps.</p>
         <p>When you are first beginning to furnish your space with plants, there are key things to consider.	 </p> 
		   
		   <h3> First Considerations.</h3>
		   
         <p>The first thing to consider; is whether you want flourishing plants, or having them contained, as in a terrarium?</p>
		   <h3> An Example:</h3>
         <p>For terrariums, you have to consider the size and type of container you want to fill, as well as location; i.e., a table, desk, or shelf, or large enough for a corner on the floor. In additon, to considering the type of lighting (See below).</p>

            The most important thing to consider is whether you have pets or children; because some plants are toxic.

		You have decided that with your time constraints low maintenance plants would be ideal, and while you have discovered some slow growing, easy care foliage plants, like the Peperomia varienties (Image Above), you have decided to begin with succulents. 
		<br>	
	    In general, succulents definately fall into the easy care category; because many can endure some neglect. Now that you know the type of plants you want to start with, you now have to decide how to contain them.</p>
		<br>	  
	    <p> Not to mention, the lighting situation for their new home. <br>
	    Will they be in individual pots, as a collection in a single pot, or in a terrarium?
		<br>	
	    You decided on the terrarium for a number of reasons, but mainly because they look like a piece of art in addition to being a functional display of plants.</p>
