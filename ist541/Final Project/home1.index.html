  <div class="stepDescription">
  <blockquote>
	  <br>
  My affinity for houseplants began  as a child. I have vivid memories of my mother in the garden, planting or potting plants. She had houseplants, but preferred being outside in the garden. Under her tutelage, I learned that there are similar principles of gardening that apply to keeping houseplants.
				  <br>
				  <br>
    It is this experience, and caring for houseplants that my affinity for them continues. To me, keeping houseplants is another form of creativity; an art form. Because they add to the aesthetic of your living space, as well as nuture the soul. The foliage green color of houseplants is joyful to me which is why I wanted to create this website. <br> <br></blockquote>

	 <p> This website is about the basics of houseplants and what it takes to care for them. Also included is a bit of history, including when the first terrarium was discovered and by whom. Further included, is why they are good for us, what is required to build a terrarium, and additional resources for your becoming an effective plant parent.  </p>
	 
	<p>	This website will also inform on the types of plants that will thrive in the home depending on how much care is required. Some plants require more fuss than others, and if you do not have time for fussy plants there are many options without requiring a lot of time to invest.</p>
	 <br>
	  <br>
	  <blockquote><br>
	 Personally, I like plants that have unique attributes. The plants can have variegated foliage, leaves that curl, <br> something that,may look designer, but is actually easy to care for, and not fussy. <br> <br> </blockquote>

			<br>
		  My current fascination is with air plants, or tillandsia. There are many varieties with unique characteristics, 700 species, apparently. They do not require soil, which makes them easier to care for because there is no mess. Some varieties only need the occasional mist of water while others require a dunk into a vessel  to soak. <br> <br></blockquote>

	<p>In my search for resources on air plants, I came across this website;
		<br>
		<br>
		<a href="https://airplanthub.com"> AirPlant Hub</a></p>
			
	<p> They are an airplant nursery, local to California and direct ship. In comparison to the plants I collected from a big box store their prices are great depending on the size of plant or product you choose to purchase. They are easy to make terrariums with, and you can be as decorative or as simplistic as you like | <br>
