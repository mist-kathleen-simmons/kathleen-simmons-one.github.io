		<h4> The Fertile Crescent </h4>  
	  <p> According to Molly Williams; Plants, or rather the domestication of plants have a long history. The history began during the agricultural revolution around the Fertile Crescent, now known to span modern-day middle eastern countries at around 10,000bce. When wild grains grew to provide sustenance. These grains are the same cereal grains of today and were cultivated during this Neolithic era. At the same time, domesticating lentils, flax and chickpeas occurred. Crops grew because of early irrigation structures between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. From this point forward, the more plants were domesticated, and the more their popularity evolved, they eventually were brought indoors.</p></div>

		<h4> The Ancient Power Houses</h4>
		
		<p>The ancient Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks kept cultivated plants for decorative purposes. They inhabited homes and public spaces. For thousands of years, plants went from being utilitarian (food provision) to being status symbols for the wealthy. The first gardening guide appeared during the era between 350BCE and 287BCE by Greek botanist Theophrastus, called “Historia Plantarum,” a series of ten books on plants and their origins. Theophrastus studied under Plato, then Aristotle, and then became head of the Lyceum after Aristotle left Greece in Exile.</p></div>

			<h4> The Ancient Romans and Health </h4> 
	  <p> The Roman Greenhouse was invented; because Emperor Tiberius, in 30CE, became deathly ill, and was told by physicians to eat cucumbers daily. Not an easy feat by any means. These greenhouses were not anything like we have today. Many were made of mica and selenite for protection, and only housed small potted plants. They were initially called solariums, or specularia. The larger greenhouses were built with high walls and transparent ceilings, all to furnish Tiberius with cucumbers, which allowed him to live several years longer. </p> </div>

		<h4>  Illuminating Anecdotes</h4>
		<p>While this brief introduction into the history and origins of plant cultivations and their domesticity, including early plant growth mechanisms. There is so much more interesting information in this book. This book is evolutionary, and therefore, espouses information through a timeline of events up to our modern times.</p>

	 <h5>The terrarium was an accidental discovery by Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, in 1820's London.</h5>
	 <br> 
	 <br>
	<p>
	  Imagine London England at that time. Like many places in the world, the industrial revolution was in fullforce, <br>
	 and factories all over London were working - making foul dirty air that hampered the growth of many plants. With Ward's invention, various plant species were able to thrive without being in such caustic air.</p> </div>

	<p>Botanists of the day were experimenting with cross-ocean voyages and exchanging many varieties of plant species. One thing they lacked was proper monitoring and storage for these vulnerable plant species during these voyages. Then, by accident, Nathaniel Ward creates transportable glass houses, that work for both the home, and voyages going abroad.</p> </div>
	 			
  <div align="left">
   <p>"It was Ward’s eureka moment. Tightly-sealed glass cases could be used to control humidity (very good for ferns) and air quality (also very good for ferns). Ward’s 1842 book Of the Growth of Plants in Closely Glazed Cases and the display of his cases at the 1851 Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations publicized his exciting discovery."</p>
